# Zenchain Reward Tracker - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Design System Approach**: Material Design with crypto-focused adaptations
- **Justification**: Financial applications require trust, clarity, and efficient data presentation. Material Design provides excellent data visualization patterns while maintaining professional credibility.
- **Key Principles**: Data clarity, trust through consistency, efficient information architecture, responsive grid systems

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode Primary** (crypto industry standard):
- **Primary**: 259 84% 65% (deep purple-blue for trust and technology)
- **Secondary**: 220 15% 25% (dark gray-blue for backgrounds)

- **Surface**: 220 15% 12% (slightly lighter cards/panels)
- **Text Primary**: 0 0% 95% (near white)
- **Text Secondary**: 0 0% 70% (muted gray)

### B. Typography
- **Primary**: Inter (clean, excellent for financial data)
- **Monospace**: Fira Code (for addresses, amounts, hashes)
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - H1: 2rem, semibold (dashboard titles)
  - H2: 1.5rem, medium (section headers)
  - Body: 0.875rem, regular (data tables)
  - Caption: 0.75rem, medium (labels, metadata)

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Consistent use of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 units
- **Grid**: 12-column responsive grid
- **Containers**: Max-width constraints for optimal reading
- **Cards**: 8px rounded corners with subtle shadows
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace between data sections (p-6, gap-8)

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**:
- Sidebar navigation with wallet management
- Top bar with user actions and notifications
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep sections

**Data Display**:
- Clean data tables with sortable columns
- Metric cards showing key reward statistics
- Interactive charts using Chart.js with dark theme
- Progress indicators for loading states

**Forms**:
- Wallet address input with validation
- Filter controls for reward history
- Search functionality with autocomplete

**Overlays**:
- Modal dialogs for wallet management
- Toast notifications for API status
- Loading overlays with skeleton states

### E. Animations
**Minimal Approach**: 
- Subtle transitions (200ms) for state changes only
- Number counting animations for reward updates
- Chart animations on data load (800ms duration)
- No decorative animations to maintain professional focus

## Visual Treatment

**Professional Crypto Aesthetic**:
- Clean lines and geometric shapes
- Emphasis on data readability
- Subtle gradients only in chart visualizations
- High contrast for accessibility
- Consistent iconography using Heroicons
- Generous whitespace to reduce cognitive load

**Data Visualization**:
- Line charts for reward trends over time
- Bar charts for comparative analysis
- Donut charts for portfolio breakdown
- Color-coded status indicators
- Responsive chart containers

## Images
**No Hero Image**: This is a utility application focused on data presentation
**Icon Usage**: 
- Cryptocurrency icons for different reward types
- Status icons for connection states
- Wallet icons for address management
- Chart icons for data visualization sections

## Key Considerations
- **Trust Building**: Consistent, professional appearance
- **Data Density**: Efficient use of screen space for multiple wallets
- **Responsive**: Mobile-optimized for on-the-go reward checking
- **Performance**: Fast loading with skeleton states during API calls
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support
